    "text": "Study in Finland | FAQ 🇫🇮 - Study in Finland | FAQ 🇫🇮 FAQ On this page you will find answers to some frequently asked questions about studying in Finland. Share Are scholarships available for international students? Some Finnish universities may offer scholarships or tuition fee waivers for non-EU/EEA students, so check the possible scholarship options with the university in Finland you're applying to. Note that the universities' scholarships do not as a rule cover any living or travel costs. There are no governmental scholarships available for bachelor's and master's studies in Finland - no such programme as \"Fully Funded Finland Government Scholarships\" exists. See our article on scholarship facts ! How much will I need to cover my living costs? Finland is a relatively expensive country to live in, so we recommend you reserve approximately €900 – €1200 per month for your living expenses (accommodation, food, travel). Can I work while studying in Finland? International students are allowed to work part-time up to 30 hours per week on average during the academic year and full-time during holidays. Students may also find internships related to their field. However, keep in mind that finding employment is challenging, especially if you do not know Finnish or Swedish - so you should not base your financial plans on the uncertain prospect of finding a part-time job during your studies. Can I bring family members with me? This is possible, but you must take into account that you and your family need to have enough money for living in Finland . While working is allowed for a student's family member, remember it is quite difficult to find employment especially without Finnish or Swedish skills. The universities and student housing foundations also have a limited amount of family apartments available. How do I apply to a university in Finland? You apply through the national portal Studyinfo.fi . The application forms are available online at Studyinfo.fi only during the application periods. See our starter's info on Admissions .

In September there is another joint application period, which usually includes a limited amount of studies starting in January. You can check the joint application timetables at Studyinfo.fi . Some degree programmes are not included in the joint application system, but have separate application periods. For example, a number of universities' master's programmes have their admissions open from November or December onwards. Always check the application timetables and other details with the university or UAS you plan to apply to! What are the admission requirements?
